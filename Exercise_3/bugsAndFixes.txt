1. calculate_average_hours

    Bug: Used an undefined variable in len(), and returned the wrong name.

    Fix: Switched to len(volunteer_list) and return the correctly named avg.



2. filter_by_city

    Bug: Compared without lower‑casing both sides and tried to call add() on a list.

    Fix: normalize with row["City"].lower() == city.lower() and use result.append(row).



3. load_data

    Bug: Tried to open an undefined file variable instead of using the function argument.

    Fix: Open file_path (the passed‑in parameter) and read from that.



4. __main__ block

    Bug: Called load_data() with a wrong variable name.

    Fix: Ensure the argument matches the defined file_path variable.
